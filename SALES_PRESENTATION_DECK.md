## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### Today's WMS Landscape is Broken

**Traditional Systems (Oracle, SAP, Manhattan):**
- 💸 **Too Expensive:** $40,000-$100,000/month licensing
- ⏰ **Too Slow:** 6-12 months implementation
- 🔧 **Too Complex:** Months of training required
- 📊 **Too Rigid:** Customization costs $500K+

**The Market Gap:**
- Small-to-mid size warehouses can't afford enterprise WMS
- Legacy systems are 20+ years old with outdated UI
- Growing e-commerce demands modern, flexible solutions
- Cloud-first approach is no longer optional
