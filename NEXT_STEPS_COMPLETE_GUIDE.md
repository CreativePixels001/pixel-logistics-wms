---

## ❓ OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Too Expensive"

### "Need to Think About It"
**Response:** "I understand. What specific concerns do you have? Let me address those now. Also, this pilot pricing is only for first 10 customers - several spots already filled."

### "Already Have a System"
**Response:** "What are you using now? [Listen] How much does it cost annually? [Calculate savings] Would saving $XXX thousand per year while getting better features interest you?"
