### ⏰ HOUR 4: First Outreach

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Cut WMS costs by 95% - Live Demo Available

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] operates a [size] warehouse in [location]. 

Quick question: Are you currently using Oracle/SAP for warehouse management, or managing with spreadsheets?

We just launched Pixel Logistics WMS - think "Oracle WMS functionality at 5% of the cost."

Key stats:
• $299-$1,999/month (vs $40K-$100K/month)
• 8-week implementation (vs 12 months)
• 100% cloud-native, mobile-ready

Would you be open to a 20-minute demo this week?

[Include demo link]

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - First 10 customers get 50% off for 3 months + free implementation ($10K value)
```

**LinkedIn Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your post about [relevant topic]. 

We just launched a modern WMS that's disrupting the Oracle/SAP model - 95% cost savings, 10x faster deployment.

Perfect for [their industry] operations like yours.

Open to a quick 15-min demo?
```

## 💡 DEMO TIPS (CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS)

### Before the Demo

**1. Qualify the Prospect (5 min pre-call)**
- Current WMS or system?
- Warehouse size?
- Pain points?
- Decision-making process?
- Budget/timeline?

**2. Prepare Custom Demo**
- Use their industry terminology
- Show relevant workflows
- Prepare specific examples
- Have answers ready for common objections

### During the Demo

**1. Start Strong (First 2 Minutes)**
```
"Thanks for joining! Before we dive in, quick question:
What's your biggest challenge with [current system/process]?

[Listen, then...]

Perfect - I'll show you exactly how Pixel Logistics solves that.
We've helped similar [industry] companies reduce [pain point] by 30-40%."
```

**2. Follow the STAR Pattern**
- **Situation:** "Currently you're using..."
- **Task:** "You need to..."
- **Action:** "Here's how our system handles that..."
- **Result:** "Which means you'll see..."

**3. Handle Objections**

**Objection 1:** "We need to see it with our data"
- **Answer:** "Great! We offer a 30-day pilot. You can import sample data and test with your team. Zero risk."

**Objection 3:** "How is this different from [competitor]?"

# Open: http://localhost:8080
```

### "Prospect Not Responding"
